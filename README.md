# mydefender
This was a project in my first year of Epitech and therefore coded in C.<br/>
I coded this project together with my fellow students Alexander Prosch Patryk Buchholz.<br/>
For a succesfull compilation is the csfml library required.<br/>
Use the Makefile to compile all the code with GCC, the binary name will be "my_defender".<br/>
