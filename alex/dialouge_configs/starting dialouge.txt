For a newcomer that was a solid landing 7/10*
.....*
Oh sorry where are my manners,
the name is John, John Titan
and welcome inside your grave*
What are you talking about?
AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH GRAVE!?*
Jeez could have atleast introduced yourself
befor drilling me with questions.*
sorry... I am-*
NOPE, to late now, i am just gonna call you...
mmmm idiot from now on.*
And with grave i meant grave.*
You see there is no way out of this thing.*
I landed here about two days ago
and since then havn't found an exit.*
what about that door?*
oh yeah i totally forgot about checking the
GIANT DOOR BEHIND ME.*
of course i checked the freaking door.
It is locked and needs a special key.*
So not really the answer to our problem.
Unless of course...*
You find the key.*
I searched everywhere,
but maybe the gods blessed you with more luck.
